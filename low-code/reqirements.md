# Low-Code Framework Requirements

## Overview

The goal of this low-code framework is to provide a platform for building and deploying business applications with minimal hand-coding. The framework should enable users to design, develop, and manage applications through an intuitive interface while maintaining the flexibility to customize and extend functionalities as needed.

## Functional Requirements

- **Drag-and-Drop Builder**
  - Allow users to create application interfaces by dragging and dropping components onto a canvas.
  - Support for responsive design.

- **Component Library**
  - Provide a comprehensive library of pre-built UI components (e.g., forms, buttons, tables, charts).
  - Allow users to create and add custom components.

- **Templates**
  - Offer a range of pre-designed templates for common use cases.
  - Allow users to save and reuse their templates.

### 2. Data Management

- **Data Modeling**
  - Enable users to define data models and relationships between entities.
  - Support for common data types (e.g., string, number, date, boolean).

- **Data Binding**
  - Allow easy binding of data to UI components.
  - Support for real-time data updates.

- **Integration with External Data Sources**
  - Provide connectors for popular databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
  - Enable integration with APIs and other external data sources.

### 3. Logic and Workflow

- **Visual Workflow Designer**
  - Allow users to define business logic and workflows visually.
  - Support for conditional logic, loops, and branching.

- **Event Handling**
  - Enable users to define actions triggered by user interactions or system events.
  - Support for custom event handlers.

### 4. Extensibility

- **Custom Code Integration**
  - Allow users to add custom code (e.g., JavaScript, Python) where needed.
  - Provide an integrated code editor with syntax highlighting and error checking.

- **Plugin Architecture**
  - Support the creation and integration of plugins to extend the framework's capabilities.
  - Provide documentation and examples for plugin development.

### 5. Deployment and Management

- **One-Click Deployment**
  - Enable one-click deployment of applications to various environments (e.g., local, cloud).
  - Provide deployment status and logs.

- **Version Control**
  - Integrate with version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage application versions.
  - Allow users to roll back to previous versions.

- **User Management**
  - Support user authentication and authorization.
  - Allow role-based access control.

### 6. Performance and Scalability

- **Optimized Rendering**
  - Ensure efficient rendering of UI components.
  - Optimize for performance on various devices and screen sizes.

- **Scalable Architecture**
  - Design the framework to handle large-scale applications and high user loads.
  - Support for horizontal and vertical scaling.

### 7. Security

- **Data Security**
  - Ensure secure data transmission and storage.
  - Implement encryption for sensitive data.

- **Authentication and Authorization**
  - Support various authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, SAML).
  - Implement fine-grained access control.

### 8. Documentation and Support

- **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Provide detailed documentation for all features and functionalities.
  - Include tutorials, examples, and best practices.

- **Community Support**
  - Set up forums, chat groups, or other channels for community support.
  - Encourage community contributions and feedback.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Usability

- Ensure the framework is easy to use for both technical and non-technical users.
- Provide an intuitive and consistent user interface.

### 2. Reliability

- Ensure the framework is stable and reliable.
- Implement thorough testing and error handling.

### 3. Performance

- Ensure the framework performs efficiently under various conditions.
- Optimize for fast load times and smooth interactions.

### 4. Scalability

- Design the framework to scale with increasing data volumes and user loads.
- Support for both horizontal and vertical scaling.

### 5. Compatibility

- Ensure compatibility with major web browsers and operating systems.
- Support integration with common third-party services and APIs.

### 6. Maintainability

- Ensure the framework is easy to maintain and update.
- Provide clear guidelines for contributing and maintaining the codebase.
